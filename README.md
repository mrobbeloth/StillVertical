# StillVertical
This app is intended to help students taking the Mobile Application Development course at Mount Vernon Nazarene University (MVNU) starting Fall 2017 to understand some of the concepts being covered. It may have some aspects that are quirky in its operation, but highlight those concepts being discussed as we follow through the Big Nerd Ranch's Android text. It is possible we may cover topics not discussed in the text or at length in the text, but are shown in this app. Branches may be created to show various concepts, but not merged back into the master branch.
